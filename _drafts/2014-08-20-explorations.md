I used to keep a notebook about my training but it's a bit inconsistent so i'll try to keep track of everything here instead.

## Tuesday 19
First session of the season! I had no training for over two weeks so I was reaaaally impatient to get back on the mats. Going into the session, I wanted to practice some guard retention concepts I had seen on Keenan's website and mess around with the deep half guard. I also decided I would try to only spar hard round with people that are better than me.

As somewhat expected, my cardio was out of the window. Warm-up made me sore, my abs are gone… but that happened after the last summer break as well. I think suffering through the first couple of sessions each year is an acceptable trade off for giving my body some rest. The first cycle this year is going to be collar and sleeve guard (also known as Dariush guard). It's a cool position that I had worked on earlir this year with some success. I probably won't learn many new things from there but I don't mind working on it again. We'll probably do some basics later in september when the new white belts roll in. Yesterdays lesson was only about experimenting with the guard, getting a feel for it — a great format IMHO.

The guard retentions went alright although there is some thing I need to figure out: when I cross-step to prevent my legs getting thrown to one side, I sometimes land with the knee on the cross bicep instead of the foot. It's less effective but maybe I can still reguard from there. I managed to get into one deep half guard, did nothing from there but it felt right.

I exchanged some ideas with Salah at the end of the class. I had this idea that from top half guard, it might be worth diving into bottom deep half guard (loosing 2 points) just to sweep and pass, because I feel like passes are easier from there. If it works you end up with a sweep+pas or sweep+backtake, so +3/+4 points. Salah advised me against it because some people are good at locking you into deep half guard and if you're stuck there, you just gave two points away. I still think it may be worth it, depending on the clock and the current point number.

Again in half guard, he showed me a pass that migh work well:

- Get the knee out, as you would for a knee slice
- Post on the free leg, knee-on-belly style. Get double collar grips and lift the opponent towards you to make him post on his elbow
- Throw your free leg above his posted arm, against his neck (for a triangle). Post on your hand to help that motion
- Now slide the locked leg along the same side, trapping the remaining arm
- Lock the triangle

And a little trick/concept: when you have your two legs smashed together on the ground (say after a half guard smash pass) you can't *lift* them, but you can very easily rotate them (so that your belly faces the ground) and then circle one of the legs around the opponent, back into guard. There's a similar concept in one of Keenan guard retention videos where his leg is pinned, and he uses a lateral motion to unbalance the passer.

And I came up with a counter to a side-control transition we drill a lot. There's a tiny moment where the top player exposes his arm on your hips and motion towards your back — if in that precise moment, you push on his elbow kimura style and roll agressively to your back, you can actually push he off you. he timing is tricky but because we tend to overuse it at my academy, there's a reasonable chance I can make that work.

For the next time: as kabout knotting the lapel.
