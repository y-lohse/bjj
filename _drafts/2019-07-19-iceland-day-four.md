# Five control points

From side control, to prevent the opponent from turning into me, I need to:

1. prevent his head from facing me, turning his chin away
2. prevent the near elbow to get to his ribs
3. prevent his near knee to get to the ground
4. Prevent his far knee from crossing the center line
5. Prevent his far shoulder to lift off the ground

When in side control, I should count how many control points I have. If I have none, he's about to escape. I have one, I've almost lost control. If I have 2, it's a battle, but I'm not too bad. And if I have three or more, I'm good.

Conversely, on bottom side control I need to free enough of these control points in order to escape. Whenever I can free one of them, it gets easier to turn into my opponent.

If the opponent tries to turn *away* from me, the control points are mirrored, but it's the same battle. This means I can control which direction he will turn to by shutting down one side, but leaving the other open, and anticipating.

For a total pin, on both side, I need control points… on both side. So maybe keep the head towards me, but prevent the far shoulder from lifting up.

# Levers by Steve

A lot of ways to hook the opponents leg and twist it in order to sweep. From half guard, get a underhook then bring the outside leg over the oponents trapped leg, and roll under him. From butterfly, if he posts, grapevine with the lifting leg, get on my knees and sit back.

But the ones I will probably use the most: from half guard, get into the kneebar attack by swimming under, but instead of fishing for the knee, grab the closest foot with the hand that would normally be between the legs, and bring it into my chest.

The other one is from shin to shin, grab my toes with my same side hand, going outside the oppoentns leg, and pull into single leg X from there. It's like a regular shin to shin pull, but without needing to hug his leg. From there Steve takes the back or sweeps too.

# Panda guard

Sitting, keep the elbows closed, like in turtle guard, protect my head from chokes with m shoulder, and lean to the side where the attacks come from, closing the space between my arm and my thigh.

If I do get checoked, I can turn *into* the choke, literally pivoting 90 degrees, then grabing his arm with mine and "falling" to the open side. From there, get back on my knees by keeping the arm to get top control.

The same strategy also works if the opponent puts a leg in. It requires doing it not too late, but I can flare up my elbow, and then turn into his leg, lifting i with both my arms, and then rolling to the open side. I wonder if this also works from turtle.

For Gi chokes, as long as they don't control my arm or lapel on the choking side, I should be abble to roll out of it, by rolling "over" their choking hand.

Finally, if they put the pressure on me with their chest, i can bring one leg in and roll (like really roll on my side, not a forward roll). And… something should happen.

# Late arm bar escapes

Pritt manages to "eat" and arm bar by rotating his elbow without the wrist, presumably from the shoulder.

But mostly he has a defense. He uses "active" turning of his wrist, so he will turn has much as he can to the reverse of a hitchiker, butwhen he feels the opponent is going to twist his arm the other way, he goes with hit and goes full hitchiker.

He's always on his side and never flat on his back. Obviosuly if he's facing the opponent he's already sort of out, but he will mostly face away from his — presumably to gain shoulder mobility.

He keep his free elbow close to his chest, and will get a grip on the oponents leg that's nearest to that hand. And then he will shrimp *into* the opponent, bumping into them with his butt so that they fall to the side. Once there he can turn towards them and get his arm out by baby bridging away.

If the opponent turns to the opposite side, facing the incoming shrimping motion, he needs to turn is elbow out again. For that he posts on his free elbow and guides his arm into his back, in panda position but with only one arm, and then he inverts out of it.
