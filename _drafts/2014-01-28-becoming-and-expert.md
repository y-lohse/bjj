title: Becoming an expert
---
Yesterday I was thinking about the need for more comentators in jiu jitsu, but bitching about it isn’t going to help. So when I came home I pulled up a video of a match and tried to do the commentating… and wow I sucked. I knew almost nothing about the fighters background, their usual game, I struggled to understand some of the refs actions. And at the end of the training yesterday, while chatting with my instructor, he named about 10 fighters that he saw at the europeans… and I had heard of maybe half of them.

That means after almost 2 years of doing bjj, I still haven’t a clear understanding of the rules (that’s ridiculous, I compete and still can’t read a refs gestures) and I have a very loose knowledge of the greatest competitors.

Expertise can be observed very easily when someone demonstrates the ability to draw connections between what he’s paying attention to and things he has studied in the past. For example, today I showed expertise twice. 
A friend of mine showed me a proof for his new visit card — I wouldn’t say I’m expert at design, but I’m fairly good at it and I’m quite close to being an expert when it comes to typography. Only glancing at it, I could immediately identify the style he used, pull up similar concepts in my head, match them against his card and asses the strengths and weaknesses of it.

The second time when a colleague made me listen to a new track he recorded with his bands — again, I may not be an expert in music but I listen to music almost constantly, I’ve been playing guitar for 10 years and toyed around with other instruments. Again, I easily saw from which bands their inspiration came from and how well their song stacked up against those references.

Not so much in jiu jitsu. where most of my techniques come from, but outside of my game I’m as edecuated as any suessex-based middle-age peasant. My instructor can draw connections no matter what technique I just saw on youtube. TrumpetDan seems like a living encyclopedia.

Once I knew enough about programing / design / music to draw connections, I skyrocketed. I need this for my bjj.
