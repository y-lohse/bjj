Aside from all the notes I took during the camp, Id like to reflect a little on the overall experience. Here we go.

# The Coaches

I had a lot of questions about who my favorite coach or what my favorite lesson was, but I still haven't figured it out. There were simply too many high level experiences to pick just one.

# The Camp
- soreness & info overload
- training all day
- people at the camp
- food

# Socializing
- ucpa & speed dating
- christiana
- party
