title: Black belt seminar
---
I attended [another seminar](http://yannick-lohse.fr/bjj/2014/02/02/seminar-with-black-belt.html) at my old academy two weeks ago, but I have to say this one lacked the systemic approach that David Pierre-Louis usually has when teaching (even though he was the one teaching this time too). We went through a couple of different positions but there was no clear progression this time. There are a couple of usefull tips that I was abble to take away but there was no eye-opening moment.

It also was an opportunity to roll with both old friends and newcomers and I have to say I felt very solid. I had rolls with people that used to be way better than me and I gave them a run for their money. David paid it back to me for [last time](http://yannick-lohse.fr/2014/02/02/week-end-complement.html) but I was exhausted and he was fresh, so I guess we’ll have a final next time.

I do feel there are some issues in the academy though, especially seen from the outside. They have a 15 year old white belt, now promoted to orange who *is* good, but just not *that* good either. The "problem" is that he’s apparently able to give a hard time to our coaches, absorbs youtube techniques very easily and was noticed by David Pierre-Louis. If feel all of this must have flaired up his ego because he seemed quite upset when I submitted him — without much effort. I went for my standard game — pull guard, threaten submissions, go to the back and submit — without *any* problem, even discarding a lot of opportunities on the way. He certainly has talent but I’m afraid it will be wasted.

One of the guys told him afterwards "Don’t worry, he’s ben doing this a lot longer than you". I wonder what he thought when I did the very same thing to him during the next roll, because he’s both much larger than me and has been training for a longer time. Amidst the new belts that were given out that day, the fact that he got his blue made me cringe most.
