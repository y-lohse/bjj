# Stretching

great start to the day, a mix of yoga and cardio.

# Guard retention

Never let the opponent have control of the knees. If it happens, strip and grip immediately.
Control of the knee can ba with hands, but also elbows, shoulders, hips, knees…

From double under, slide a thumb in the grip, bridge up, hip out and get a knee back in. Better than endlessly sliding backwards as I do.
If too late and the pass has started, frame by placing the forearm inside the armpit , sit out and shrimp away.

Basically 2 concepts:

- strip the grips, using a hand or a forearm, off the knee
- if too late to strip, turn away and start shrimping, keeping a frame with the opponent
- bonus concept: don't keep the whole spine on the mat to improve mobility

# Butterfly guard

Not much new stuff. Use the lower leg to elevate my own hips more to complete the pass, instead of elevating the opponent all the time. Other than that it's what I already to.

A new tip isin quarter mount (for example after a butterfly sweep where oneleg gets stuck and I don't have an underhook that allows me to knee cut), I have to:

- for the leg that is caught, place my knee in the corner of the opponents hips, really at hip level, not higher
- my other knee goe sbehind his butt, and I try to clamp my knees together to contrl te hip
- be at a 45° angle with the opponent

# Leg lock defense

Pendulum to get up when someone dives on ashi.

Hopping ON the foot (and not over) to defend the ankle lock. From there, turn the hips completely towards the opponent an pry open the knee. The hip turn is really important.

Getting out of the honey hall, pretty standart turning to hide the heel, completely free up the non trapped leg and then use that to push the other leg out.

# Half guard pass, no gi

Like a smash pass, but the non smahisng hand grabs the opponent behind the head and folds him in 2. Smash, get the knee out and keep the head control until the pass is secured.
After the pass, it's also possible to put the right knee ober the opponents leg, like at the end of a leg weave pass, and from there transition to mount or side control.

An early defense against the underhook coming in, is pinching the elbow AND meeting him with the chest. From there, get the underhook on the other side, flatten him out, bring the arm from the underhook side over the head, and go into a standard kimura style pass, either peeling of the leg, or doing a kimura.

If the underhook is in, transition to a whizer. For a good whizer, press down on the joint between the chest and shoulder. It's better if the arm is not in too deep for the whizzer, a good help is to grab my own thigh. From there, turn away and go into a dogfight like position. Limp leg out, and turn around to face the opponent. Alternatively, flatten them out and then backstep.

# Loop choke

Comes from lots of position, but we had it from z-guard. Grab the collar with the upper hand, where exactly has a huge effect and varies by person, for me it's almost in the neck. Post on the elbow.

From there it's a trap, the opponent needs to get their head down. If they strip the grip or posture up, it wont work. Although it's possible to kick out their far knee to make them drop the head, but the best way is to entice them into a smash pass.

Once the head is low, start moving to the other side (posting on the hand and lettting go of the z-guard), bring the lower arm above the neck, then under my own elbom. Finish with the back of my hand against my elbow, and this is really important to have a good structure. Finally, bring down the lower lbow in between the 2 bodies. Turn towards the mat and the lower elbow to finish the choke.

I can use my upper leg to to clamp on his back to avoid his attempts at stripping a grip or rolling. But I can also use it as a sweep, either when the opponent turns to avoid the choke, or by using a butterfly sweep.
