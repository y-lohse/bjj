title: Thoughts on learning BJJ
---
In my experience, there are 3 ways you can teach bjj to someone, and i believe one of them is highly effective while the others might not be so great.
The first one is bottom line stupid: Teach techniques individually, without connecting them together. This is purely based on memory, the student who retains the most information wins. It’s the equivalent of learning your times table by heart; I mean, sure, you *can* do it — but if you can’t remember 5x8 when you need it you’re screwed. The smarter option is to learn the principle of multiplication, and boom, you’re done. At first you may be a little slow to spit out the answer, but you become faster as you grow used to applying the principle.
I feel it’s the same for bjj. At some point (apparently around purple belt) knowing techniques is not enough, you need to learn how to chain them together to improve. You need to connect all the dots.
The second teaching method tries to solve that, but not in a very elegant manner. The idea is to teach strings of moves instead of individually scoped techniques. Like a guard pass, a transition to mount and a submission.
That’s better, because now the student has this collection of pathes he can follow and it’s easy to figure out how to get from one path to the other. The issue I have with that is you end up being very dependent on what your opponent does.
Say you’re in side control, you know a path where you can transition to mount but it requires that your opponent gets an underhook. What if he doesn’t take it? You either wait until he takes it (in my experience, this usually fails brutally) or discover a way to force him to take it. That’s *okay* but it does require you to discover and learn the trick to force him — and honnestly as a white belt I have enough things to focus on as it is.
When I was in school, I used to make sure I never learned my lessons by heart — not that I couldn’t, I remembered a lot of other pointless things very well — but since I had figured out the principle it was enough for me. I could apply them during the tsts and do just as well as students who had spent hours memorizing every bit of the lesson. i’ve been trying to do the same in bjj, but honestly the principles are hard to figure out if nobody points them out to you.
But I’ve had some teachers that did, and these are the lessons I still remember the most today. Here’s how it goes: starting from a very common position, we were taught a few simple steps to get into a slightly uncommon situation, usually one with tension where you won’t stay for long. Then from that position, we would learn several ways you can move on, and several ways you could get countered. From what I understand, this is called a system (more on this later).
Like with pathes, it’s easy enough for the student to connect different systems together but this time there is no room for hazard. Another benefit is that you teach both situations at once: how to attack from that position and how to defend. Your success becomes merely a factor of technical precision — something you acquire over time. You may also get an edge if you find a new creative option within the system — and since you understand the system as a whole and not as a set of individual techniques, this doesn’t actually require to be a genius.

From what I understand, this is called a system, maybe a reference to the chess equivalent — althought in chess this seems to refer to higher level strategic thinking. As of now, I would define a bjj system as a tense situation where both players need to choose from a limited set of options.
Tense because you cannot stay there for long. It may be muscular tension, but it’s mainly that there are oppenings for both players and as such it’s only a matter of time until a player seizes an opening. Using an opening does not immediately lead out of the system. The seizing may succeed or be countered and will lead to a situation.
This new situation may be tense or not — if it isn’t, it’s usually a controlled, closed position. If it’s tense, it may be the same as before, or a new one and in that case a new system will usually kick into gear.
A limited set of options — as in 4 or 5 for each player. This is because I’m not refering to generic positions from which there are a huge amount of possibilities. It’s an overseeable situation, a fragile one that cannot be distbalanced in many different ways.




# Thoughts on teaching bjj
### Dots, Paths and Shapes
#### Introduction
Some thoughts published here and there made me think a bit harder about the way jiu jitsu is taught and learned, at least in the different academies I’ve trained at. There are 3 different ways I could identify, ranging from rather bad to really effective.
#### Learning Dots
There are two ways you can learn your time tables: by heart or by learning the principle of multiplication. The first way relies on memory alone and when you are asked to solve 6x3, you search in your memory to find the answer. You either remember it or not, and if not you’re screwed.
On the other hand, once you have learned the principle you can solve any multiplication - even 13x27 which nobody learns by heart. It might be slower in the beginning but in time everyone learns to multiply likes this.
#### Techniques are dots
In Jiu Jitsu, individual techniques are dots and sometimes they are taught as such. Remembering individual techniques here and there without focusing on the principle behind them is like learning time tables by heart - it’s purely based on memory, not intelligence. It works well at first for a limited set of options but in the long run it’s not an acceptable solution.
With dots, the student knows technical execution and tries to figure out how to follow up a successful technique.
#### Together, they form paths
The first apparent shortcoming of learning this way is that you soon need to string techniques together in order to be effective. If you stop and think after every move you’ll get crushed.
Now instead of focusing on individual dots, you can learn paths: how to chain a set of techniques together, like a guard pass, a transition to mount, a choke fake and an armbar.
Now the student knows how to chain moves, but is limited by what his opponent gives him. He might know what he needs to do next but if hes opponent knows it too, he will get stuck.
#### Crafting a map
In school, I used to take few notes and instead focused on understanding the principles that drove what the teachers were explaining. Again, it’s about using intelligence rather than memory. I tried to do the same with bjj, but the principles are hard to figure out.
However, I’ve had lessons focused on a principle rather than a technique or a string of techniques, and these are the lessons I remember the best. We’d usually start in a common position, make a simple move to get into a position with some tension. From thereon, the teacher would show a couple of ways you could move on, and a couple of ways you could get stuffed.
This way has several major advantages:
1. You learn several paths at once
2. It’s easy to figure out how to go from one path to another depending on what the opponent does
3. Because you can see a range of options you have, it’s easy to figure out the common parts of them - the principle of the position
4. You teach at once how to attack and defend from that position
Now your success becomes merely a factor of technical precision — something you acquire over time. You may also get an edge if you find a new creative option within that situation — and since you understand it as a whole and not as a set of individual techniques, this doesn’t actually require to be a genius.
#### Don’t skip steps (probably?)
I suppose it’s still necessary to first learn dots and paths - focusing on maps when you still struggle with technical execution will probably set you back more than anything.
