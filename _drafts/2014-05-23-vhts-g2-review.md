title: Gi Review: VHTS G2
---
**Disclaimer**: i'm really not a gi expert. I only tried a handfull of them (albeit you could say I tried both the top and the bottom of the ladder) and the only reason I know the differences between different materials is because I looked them up before writting this review. I do know a thing or two about design. Also, I paid for the gi myself and no on asked me to write this.

## Very Hard To Submit
VHTS is a small brand from New York. From their about us page:

> Each series of Kimono has been custom made at a limited number so as to give each kimono a unique and one of a kind feel. Just as armor was worn by knights to not only protect but also to represent their where they were from; we look to do the same with our line of kimonos.

This is exactly the sort of values that I care about, so the obvious dedication to their craft struck a chord in me. They currently sell 3 models of gis and some other clothing.

At this point I should probably describe my body type: I'm 1m96 tall (that's about 6'5") and walk around at 87 kolis (190 pounds). You might as well call me the dead spot on every sizing chart, because most A4 gis end a 6'4" but **start** at 220 pounds, and A5 starts covers 6'5" but start at over 250 pounds. I usually have to pick between walking in a potato sack or in pants that look like shorts.

Because it was an international order I really didn't want to send the gi back so I wrote to VHTS bfore ordering — and the contact was great. They answered my questions within hours and were very helpfull. I paid 130$ for the gi and 40$ for the shipping, so that's 124€ which is the price for a good gi in France anyway. It arrived within 3 weeks or so with some free stickers and patches.


## The design
An older product description of the G2 explained how the design is based on the original Gundam Wing which is the second thing that completely won my heart over. A gi designed like an armor? Great. A gi designed after a freaking MOBILE SUIT ARMOR COMBAT ROBOT? Hell yeah! Plus I used to watch the anime when I was a kid.

Childhood memories aside, the design is great*ish*. It has a quite sober appearance and the white stitches create subtil motives — but the whole design is carried by the 2 colored edgings along the collar which looks fantastic. The red and white create a strong contrast with the blue and because they run along the whole collar it makes you look kinda taller.

There are 2 aspects that bother me a little about the design though. First, the overall minimalism conflicts with the "abundance" of patches. Now, I've seen more patches on a gi, but there is one on each arm, one on the pants, another one at the botttom of th jacket. And a hidden one inside. I don't mind them, they are rather small and they look all very good but I wonder if they didn't get carried a bit away and started adding patches freneticaly on an otherwise clean design.

The other thing is that the jacket and pants are not the same blue ^.^  It's a bit odd, and while it doenst bother me either it might look as if one of the 2 clothing was washed a bit too hard.


# Wearing the armor
add collar and shrinking, good stitching

For starters, the G2 is easily the best cut I've ever worn, it just seems made for tall, lean body types. It's really closer to wearing a suit than an armor, except not as comfortable. Actually not very comfortable. The 550g pearl weave of the jacket started of rather soft but became a bit abbrasive after some washes. The gi is **very** stiff when it's done drying but the stiffness fades away after some rolling.

Speaking of fading, the white stitches started to fade away with the first washes (cold washes, mind you). But instead of actualy disapearing — which would have been annoying — the white ink got into fibers around, making the blue less blue. Clearly my biggest grief with this gi.

A training partner owns a VHTS G1 which also features 2 edgings along the collar. During a choke, a nail must have broken some stitches on one of the edgings and from tehre on it started to peel away. He was abble to stop it by seewing it again though, and I had zero issue like that.

My first gi has the most comfortable pants I've ever worn, made of cotton so soft you feel in your pijamas. People get good grips on it but when they drag you around with it it feels like a caress. On the other hand, my second gi pants are made of rip stock, a material many praise but that I found way less comfortable. Given that the G2 pants where made of cotton, I was expecting a new pair of pijamas.

It's not the case. They feel nice, btter than rip stock but not pijama grade either. The crotch area is reinforced with pearl weave, it eels very solid and looks good. The reinforced parts are just what you expect, almost unnoticable but proving th resistance you need. Even more than the jacket, the cut is great. Except for the waist gridth which is too wide but like I said, I'm on th charts dead spot. The draw string is also way too long but nice — I don't enjoy wearing a 3cm rope around my waist when rolling, so the flat design is just what I want.

# tl;dr
It's hard to find gis for tall but thin guys like me and despite some shotcommings, the VHTS G2 is a good option. The jacket fits very well, the pants tend to be too large at the waist and too short at the legs, but still very wearable. The materials degrade harshly with the first washes before stabilizing at an OK state. The design is a tat bicephalous (but hey, that's New York) but remains the strength of the G2. You'll definetely make an impression the first time you wear it.
