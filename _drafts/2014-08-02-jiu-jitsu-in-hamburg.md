title: Jiu Jitsu in Hamburg
---
I went to Hamburg for the week-end recently and used the opportunity to train there. I looked up a BJJ Globetrotter there who trans at Gracie Bara Hambrug, so that's where I went.

The academy is part of the Zanshin Dojo which is a really nice facility. They have three decently-sized BJJ rooms, a lot of fitness machinery, awesome lockers and even a sauna. But because it's not a public infrastructure I had to pay to train, a rather hefty 35â‚¬ for two sessions. I can certainly understand that they need money but a drop-in fee would have been cool.

The classes themselves were very nice, albeit short. It was my first class with an authentic brazilian black beltch, in the person of Daniel Nunes who's running the show there. He was very nice as were a lot of the students. I had a nice chat with one of their oldtime purple belts and with a french blue belt from Aix en Provence named Michel.

Over the two sessions I trained there we went through a couple of techniques but the most interesting was during the competition class on the second day. It wasn't too focused on technique but instead of a strategic approach to the mount. I enjoyed that timing was an integral part of the explanations because its something that is usually overlooked in our lessons.

I didn't have a lot of success during the rolls but it was interesting.
