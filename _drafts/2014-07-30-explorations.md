During the whole of July, the classes were free so we could do whatever we wanted. Earlier this year I'd have loved that but these days I found my game to be pretty good so I didn't really know what to work on. As a result I was mainly just fighting for fun and solidifing my game.

I did try to focus on thinking ahead and guessing what my opponent will do. In the long run it will be an useful lskill but it's actually very hard. i can be aware of my oponents options but keeping tarck of that takes all my focus and I get smashed. At least I see it coming.

Some success with deep half guard.

# Open guard concepts

I've also been watching the bjj scout video about the bicep ride, which is the counter to a pass that was used a lot against me. I wrote a very long post about the closed guard and the way I would like to see it taught, and my goal is to do the same for every aspect of jiu jitsu I master. So next up is open guard because its the other main part of my game right now. It will probably take me forever to undraft the closed guard, and even longer to piece together the one about open guard, but lets get started.

And the biceps ride helped me understand one important concept: securing the interior, or inside track. L'adversaire soit passer vos jambes. Tant que l'on ets pas dans une garde type dlr, ou le jambes sont bloqués, il peut faire tanger (écraser les jambes ou les soulever pour retourner) ou lacer (passer de coté, genre toreando). Controller l'intérieur permet de bloquer le lacage. le tangage est encore possible, mais pour le double under l'adversaire a besoin d'etre assez proche,e t le bicep tide permet de maintenir un espace minimum. Le lapel est genial parce qu'il peut bloquer le tangage dans les 2 directions, en s'enfermant la jambe dedans.

# Farewells

I never wrote a journal consistently for a long time, but I actually manage to do it with this one. Maybe it's the lack of readership, I don't know. Anyway, it's going to become a bit more personnal.

We like to say that jiu-jitsu has more value than just a martial art or a sport and that its somewhat a reflection of life itself. It sounds grandiloquent and it's easy to ge carried away with thoughts like that or sound like a lunatic, so I try to be carefull with them. Last week however there was a striking parallel… It was the week of farewells.

My last grandmother passed away on tuesday and I realized how little I knew about her. Living far away certainly did not help, but I didn't put much effort into keeping in touch, and now she's gone. And then on thursday it was the final training of the season and Jukka & Daniel, who had been training with us since september, where going home to their countries. BJJ is extended family and espcially Jukka has been a good friend I spent a lot of time with. But now they are gone as well and I probably won't see them again. I don't really know what to make of all this but the paralel is there.
