During the whole of July, the classes were free so we could do whatever we wanted. Earlier this year I'd have loved that but these days I found my game to be pretty good so I didn't really know what to work on. As a result I was mainly just fighting for fun and solidifing my game.

I did try to focus on thinking ahead and guessing what my opponent will do. In the long run it will be an useful lskill but it's actually very hard. i can be aware of my oponents options but keeping tarck of that takes all my focus and I get smashed. At least I see it coming.

I've also been watching the bjj scout video about the bicep ride, which is the counter to a pass that was used a lot against me. I wrote a very long post about the closed guard and the way I would like to see it taught, and my goal is to do the same for every aspect of jiu jitsu I master. So next up is open guard because its the other main part of my game right now. It will probably take me forever to undraft the closed guard, and even longer to piece together the one about open guard, but lets get started.

And the biceps ride helped me understand one important concept: securing the interior, or inside track. L'adversaire soit passer vos jambes. Tant que l'on ets pas dans une garde type dlr, ou le jambes sont bloqués, il peut faire tanger (écraser les jambes ou les soulever pour retourner) ou lacer (passer de coté, genre toreando). Controller l'intérieur permet de bloquer le lacage. le tangage est encore possible, mais pour le double under l'adversaire a besoin d'etre assez proche,e t le bicep tide permet de maintenir un espace minimum. Le lapel est genial parce qu'il peut bloquer le tangage dans les 2 directions, en s'enfermant la jambe dedans.
