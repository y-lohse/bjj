The Gameness Elite is my first real BJJ gi and was given to me — yep, generous friends. Before that I was wearing a 30€ judo kimono, so I kinda tried the worst and what is apparently among the bests.

## Gameness
I don't think the Gameness brand needs much introduction. One of the biggest out there, as far as I can tell they don't carry any specific values. Fair enough.

## The design
Flashy. Exhuberant. Bling? Almost.

The Gameness Elite looks good, but its no wonder it depicts a dog — if you wear it, do it with your head up and a proud look. The fine red stitches almost disapear in the shadow of the (too) many patches. The patches are a happy mix of lettering, arabescs and symbols that isn't incoherent, but certainly a bit heavy on the eye. Most of them look good, but in my oppinion the shoulders should not have been patched at all. The bulldog face is cool if you're into dogs, I'm not so I try to forget about it.

Let's say the Elite represents the hiphop side of jiu jitsu fashion — it looks good but not everyone likes to wear that style.
