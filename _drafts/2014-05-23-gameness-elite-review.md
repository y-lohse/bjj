Here's my review of the Gameness Elite. It was given to me as a good-bye gift from working colleagues in Troyes in David is to blame for the choice. I've been using it on a regualr basis for over a year now.

## Gameness
Do I need to introduce Gameness? Given they are one of the biggest brands out there, i hardly think so. They have a very common commincation and don't claim particualr values.

## The Design
If there wasn't [worse out there](), I'd say the Elite is bling. Some like to dress that way. I certainly don't.

There are a buch of patches, either stitched to the gi or directly sewn in, usually with a lot of arabesques. “Gameness Elite” is written all over the place, I'm not sure why that is.

There's this dogface grinning at people from your leg. I'm happy I don't jave to look at it because I'm wearing the gi.

The patch on the back looks really good. My mom added the circular VHTS patch, thanks mom.

The red stitches act as good looking contrast on the black.
