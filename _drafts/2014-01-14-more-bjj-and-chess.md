title: More BJJ & Chess
---
I’ve already explained the similarities I see between bjj and chess, but there is a core difference that makes bjj a much harder game. In chess, you only need to master theory — the act of moving a pawn is not a challenge. In bjj, you can have a great understanding of some conceptual theory but if you can’t execute the move properly the theory is of no use.

So while I love focusing on broad concepts and theory, I need to start drilling my moves with more intensity. No one is good enough to avoid it, and certainly not me.
