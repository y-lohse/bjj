title: Closed Guard — Second Cycle
---
This cycle draws heavily on [the first cycle](), make sure you've read it first.

Whatever the angle you're at, your possibilities are limited by the range of motion of your hips. All sweeps and attacks rely on at least some hip mobility — to create an angle, more on this later. The good news is, there aren't that many ways for your opponent to block your hips. If he uses his upper body he'll break his posture, if he uses his legs he'll sweep himself. But he can use his arms and this leads us the next cycle.

# Second Cycle: Grip Management

Without getting too much into guard passing theory here, a very common thing to do for the passer is to pin the guardians hips to the ground. Not only does this nullify a lot of attacks, it also helps passing. In this cycle we'll mainly focus on how this can be countered but bear in mind that avoiding the situation altogether is even better. The way I avoid it today is simply by attacking first.

## Conceptual Interlude: Hip Movement

Your hips can rotate along three axis. Conveniently, movement along those axes have names in the field of [flight dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw,_pitch_and_roll) that I'll be using from now on.

Rotation along any axes has an effect on your and your opponents possibilities. Blocking the opponents movement along an axis without blocking yours always give a significant advantage. Your head, arms and legs are levers that can be used to force a rotation along one axis.

So when I talked about pinning the hips or shoulders, what I really meant is preventing pitching. If your pitching is locked you're in trouble and you need to unlock it. Fast.  
You do this by fighting his grips. There are a couple of ways to break a grip — two on one, slip under, pressure the wrists, … — this area of the game is called grip management. Don't expect someone to stay idle after you broke his grip, he'll either re-grip or go for another one. My friend Mathias relentlessly refuses to get gripped and breaks every single one I get on him. This pisses me off because while he's doing it, he can't make the grip he needs himself; but however boring this is, the truth is that it's an effective strategy.

## Alternative passer grips

Another grip configuration a passer can use is one hand locking the hips, the other one pushing on the plexus. It's a *divided and conquer* type of strategy; two points of pressure instead of one, but with less pressure on each one. This grip position is pretty dangerous because you loose the little pitching that remained through your shoulders. You'ill probably want to break the plexus grip first or opên your guard.

A moderately effective grip consists in pinning the guarderos shoulders instead of his hips (using his lapel or sleeves for example). You can actualy still pitch decently with your hips and even if your arms are blocked, the passers arms are too. For my body type, I foudn hight gaurd to be the msot effective answer, but you can also work to free one of your arms or try to follow along his movements until he lets go of one arm.

Chokes are innefective. **Do not choke someone while in their closed guard**. If your opponent is in your closed gaurd and tries to choke you, he's using his 2 arms without blocking yours or restraining your movement. Some pitching will make him let go, yawing threatens an arm lock and rolling might very well sweep him. If this somehow doesnt work and the air gets tight, post your feet on his hips and push. This will at the very least create enough distance for you to breathe again.

The last common passing strategy worth mentionning is to block two options with a single grip, as in blocking the gaurderos hips and one of his arms with a single grip. It's not easy to achieve but provides a huge advantage. At that point the guardero should work to free himself pretty fast.

## Grips as a guardero

I'm afraid I can't give any generic advice on this topic. Specific attacks have specific grip setups and while I somehow understand the underlying concepts I'm unable to express them. As an apology, here are a couple of things that may help:

- Collar grips will help you break the posture
- Sleeve grips can prevent the enemy from making grips and are good entries for open guards
- Lapel grips expose you but create good openings
- Underhooks are pretty fucking powerfull
- Should *you* get underhooked, reply with an instant kimura

Next up is the third and last cycle: angles management. This second cycle introduced the concept of rolling, yawing and pitching and explained how to prevent a lock on those movements. The first cycle was about posture which is really just a result of picthing and explained what to do at different angles. The last cycle will base off those two previous chapters and dwelve deeper into how angles can be used.
