title: The compeition of competitions

Summer is over, and so is the craze of high level grappling events. We had two exceptional months *stacked* with streamed competitions and with the dust settling down, let's take a look at their relative quality. I'll review them using five criterias and a bunch of stars, because who doesn't like stars?

- **quality of fights**: the most important thing?
- **ruleset**: they heavily influence the quality of the fights.
- **commentaries**: commentaries make or break an event. Good ones shed light on the action, bad ones make you want to mute the stream.
- **production**: camera work, video quality and more.
- **venue**: mat space, lighting, etc.

# FIVE SuperLeague

FIVE is back! The organization took the grappling world by surprise in 2014, launching with a round robbin super tournament and going on to run competitions accross the USA and sponsoring major athletes. That is, until 2015, when it suddenly stopped all activities. We now know this was due to [the CEO facing health issues](http://jiujitsuvirus.com/what-happened-to-five-grappling-and-whats-next/) which seem resolved, since FIVE went back to business on August 2<sup>nd</sup>. The live stream was 22$ and the replay 12$.

## Quality of fights ★★★☆☆

A good showing all around. The men league was heavyweight but the no gi setting made sure the pace stayed reasonable; The women, as always, displayed an impressive mix of speed and technicality. Of course the fighters were a lot more point-conscious but that didn't prevent a couple of submissions from happening. Of course there was also a share of rather boring matches.

There were two super fights as well. Keenan Cornelius x Otavio Souza was pretty boring as Souza was very obviously not engaging Keenan in the sub only portion of the match, and started actually fighting only after he had conceeded his first points. I can't fathom why someone would act like this *in an exhibition match*, but well. Tonon x Miyao delivered, with both fighters going at it hard for the whole fight.

## Ruleset ★★★★☆

FIVE came up with a slight variation of the IBJJF ruleset which I think is much, much better. Guard pulls are still allowed, and double guard pulls are not penalized; however, coming up from a double guard pull gives you two points. While not discouring pulling guard, it's a strong incencitive to come up if your opponent pulls as well — more than the advantage that the IBJJF now gives.

Aside from that, the major differences are the total abscence of advantages and the legality of knee reaping — both good things if you ask me.

## Commentaries ★★★☆☆

While not fantastic by any means, the commentators did their job, describing the action as it unfold and filling in blanks with random informations.

There was a strong tendency to repeatedly state just how great the tournament, fights and rules were. They were really proud of announcing that they were using FIVE rules with no advantages (despite getting confused about those same rules every now and then) and that we were all really lucky to see these fights. And yes, it's true; but as the paid commentator of the event, you are obviously way to biased to make such a statement.

## Production ★★★★☆

The video and audio quality were both flawless. It's the sort of things that, when done well, just gets forgotten because it feels natural — but it deserves praise. Putting together a live stream with a wide audience is *hard*. A lot of bigger organiztions fail at this, so cudos to FIVE and the involved parties on their success there.

My sole yet substantial complain is the lack of replay, which is especially frustrating when you blinked during a submission.

## Venue ★★☆☆☆

The SuperLeague was at Studio 540 (if SoCal is the Meca of BJJ, then Studio 540 is in the process of becoming the [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba)) which is certainly a good training environment, but was not suited for an audience-targeted competition. While there was plenty of mat space, people sitting around the mats on 5$ chairs and neon lighting made the place look souless. That, and the window that appeared when fighters crashed into the banner in the background.

# EBI 4

The fourth edition of the Eddie Bravo Invitational took place on august 15<sup>th</sup> and was a 16 man featherweight championship. The broadcast was [here](http://www.budovideos.com/pages/eddie-bravo-invitational-4) and priced around 18$.

## Quality of fights ★★★★★

With a potential 20,000$ payout for the winner by submission, competitors at EBI *fight*. The action is fast paced and the submission rate is far above average. Joe Sotto's run is a lesson in tactical awareness and defense, Cummings was on fire with his heel hooks and Joao Miyao displayed his passing skills on top of the usual berimboloing.

Oh, and the super fights. At EBI, the super fights are up and comming girls, usually under 18 — but don't be fooled, those may very well be the best matches of the whole event. The level is insane and the action furious. A must see.

My only gripe is that there are a few "fillers" in the first round, who, while not having to be ashamed fo their performance, are not on the same level as the main contenders. Maybe the field could be more even if everyone gets paid something instead of the current winner takes all format.

## Ruleset ★★★★☆

Ten minutes of sub only fighting, followed by overtime in case of a draw. The overtime is akin to sudden-death. In turn, each fighter starts with a near submission (backcontrol or spiderweb) and the other has to escape. if you can submit your opponent and escape his attempt, you win. After three rounds without a winner, the one who escaped the fastest overall wins.

I think these rules work really well. The complete abscence of points means no one is afraid to abandon a dominant position to dive for a submission, which helps make exciting fights. The overtime rule, the big differenciator, is good because it forces action as well. It proved it works, with very few fights going the whole distance. The abscence of judges decision is also a great thing.

That said, there is a way to game the rules, and I think Joe Sotto made smart — albeit boring — use of it. You can be passive to survive the first ten minutes, start on your opponents back in OT and focus on control for a good while before attempting a submission. Aside from tiring out your opponent, this will make his clock go up and give you the win, assuming you can escape all three times. That said, there's a lot of assumption in this strategy, so it's a very minor drawback.

## Commentaries ★★☆☆☆

During the first round, the commentators felt obligated to go through the bio of each fighter, no matter what. This means you could have a crazy double leg omoplata to heel hook attack on screen while the audio was casually talking about the home gym of one of the fighters. Bios re nice fill-in information when there is little action, but it's perfectly ok to keep them out entirely.

Likewise, there is no need to repeat the rules and boast about the event every five minutes. It's not TV, nobody just accidentally landed in the middle of the EBI stream. Everyone watching has a fairly good understanding of the rules involved and is more or less fan of the format. And yes, the crowd is awesome, but no, you don't need to point it out more than once.

Some comments were good though, especially when it comes to the more esoteric 10th Planet moves. Good enthusiasm as well.

## Production ★★★☆☆

There are about three differnet cameras capturing the action from differnet angles, and the switching between them is tastefully executed. They also provide replays but they don't flow very nicely, with awkward annoucing breaks between the end of the match and the start of the replay. I didn't watch it live but I haven't heard of any streaming issues.

The audio is where the trouble is; after having a background whistle for 20+ minutes at EBI 3, this times someone was fiddling with the volume of the mics, giving some commentators a hard time. It was a limited issue, but still.

## Venue ★★★★☆

The venue looks nice and the mat area is big enough to avoid constant resets. The lighting of the scene is fantastic, keeping everything but the mats in the dark. The stage could be better (think Metamoris) but overall the EBI has found a solid venue in the Orpheum Theater of LA.
