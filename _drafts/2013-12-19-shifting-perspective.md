title: Shifting perspective
---
On some levels, jiu jitsu is about solving problems — something I’m pretty good at it since it’s my job. Programing and designing are 2 disciplines that are mostly about solving problems — how do I make the computer calculate a Fibonacci sequence in an efficient way? How do I make sure the user understands that pressing this icon will make a menu appear?

In both these disciplines, a great way to solve a problem is to shift perspectives. Considering a problem in a new light usualy helps figure out a way to solve it, so I’m trying to do the same thing in bjj, but I’m still too much of a newbie to do it properly. I’m trying to figure out open guard, so my thoughts go somewhat like this.

From the open guard, I want to land a sweep or a submission. There are 2 problems: I don’t have any precise sweep in mind and my opponent is trying to pass my guard.

Initially, I’m thinking about this in terms of position: I’m in open guard, my opponent is standing. How can I attack an omoplata from there? I tried to apply some techniques but I always end up getting passed.

A slightly different perspective is thinking of the situation in terms of distance — at what distance do I need to be to set up the attack? And when I execute it? If it fails, how do I recover distance? I can than apply this distance management to any other position, not only open guard. There are many other perspectives: grip management, posture management, pressure…

Each lesson, I focus on one of these things to improve my open guard. Each lesson I get crushed, but in different ways. At some point it only becomes a matter of combining the things I learn from each perspective.
