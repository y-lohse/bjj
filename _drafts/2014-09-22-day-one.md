# David George, DRL guard
Entry to the DLR from closed guard, opponent stands up. Mainiain closed guar, switch one foot to the hips, then the other one, keeping the hips elevated. Push on the hips with double sleve grip, "look at the clock". Put one foot away to create an angle, mainain pressure with other leg and arm. When Ready, colpase the leg which makes him step forward, put in DLR hook.

From there, keep the far side grip and grab the close side heel, pull towards the outside and work on maintaining distance. If the hook gets pressured off, push the opponent away:

1. Either with the single leg on the hip
2. or with 2 legs on the hip*3. or bring the DLR hook to the shoulder and push from there.

If he drags the leg inside his legs to haf guard, stomp on the floor to prevent the leg from stretching. From there the goal is o lift him with the DLR hook. Either alon, or by brining the second foot as a support for the hook. Additionnaly, release the sleeve nzd grab the collar to unbalance.

To sweep, push his leg with the far side leg, the DLR hook drops to the ground. The far side grip on the sleeve punches through under his close side leg, release the heel and grab my own wrist with a figure 4. On the occasion, release the figure 4 and grap the wrist/sleeve with close side hand, and the far side hand grips the far side collar. From there, roll towards the far side to make him collapse. From there, pass. If he doesnt rll, mostly by pinning his knees.

From this setup, if he breaks the grip and frees his hand, move to a sit up guard, wrapping his leg with the close side arm. Switch the hips to force him falling backwards or do a technical stand up.
