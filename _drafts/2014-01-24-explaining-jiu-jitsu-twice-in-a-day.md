# Explaining jiu jitsu twice in a day

I already had to explain jiu jitsu a couple of times, I usually go with the Don’t Wear Your Gi To The Bar technique, so basically:

- no striking but chokes and locks
- relies on technique over strength
- politely smile at gay jokes
- explain the belt system

But yesterday it happened twice; the second time was fairly “regular”, but the first one was actually quite stressfull… because it was an executive at work who was asking.
It started with him pointing out that I wasn’t setting off the rooms motion sensor while eating. Someone said I was doing only minimal movements and a third person said “that’s what martial arts give you”. So far it was funny, but the executives first question was already a clear signal that the discution was hellbound.

- *Martial arts? So what are you a black belt at?*
- *Uuuh… Brazilian jiu Jitsu, but I’m a white belt*
- *Oh, **Brazilain Jiu-Jitsu**… Ever heard of krav maga?*
- *Yeah*
- *So you know I’d win, right?*
- Sigh. *No?*
- *I have a 9mm.*

At that point I bailed out, fuck the ego, I’ll carry the BJJ flag another day. He started making up fictional scenarios where he’d lethaly use his skills or weapons against agressors. I made another half assed attempt at pointing out that killing someone might be a bit extreme, but he just kept going “Yeah, I’d rip that motherfucker apart”.

I started the polite smiling at stupid remarks until he started telling a story about a guy with a 30cm knife to someone else in the room, but I don’t know what I would have said if he wasn’t working with me. I don’t typically have an ego problem but I enjoy a bit of arguing, especially in public against someone who’s making a fool out of himself.
 
Of course the whole thing ended with a Challenge© he issued. 
I don’t know what his point was since we obviously weren’t going to start fighting. I guess it would have been smart to flatter him and decline, but jiu jitsu honor and stuff, you know.
I half jokingly said we could do it, so he had to find an excuse to refuse. He (of course) went with the “my reflexes are too lethal” thing an left the room on that note.

This leaves me somewhat wondering about my own behaviour. Maybe it was the perspective of not being able to train for three straight days that made me sensitive about jiu jitsu being discarded by a wanabe self defense expert, but it pissed me off enough to hold ground against one of my bosses in front of everyone else, which is really not common in our company. Had it been a random dude at a party, I’m pretty sure I would have gone the extra mile to actively make him look like an ass. Heck, I might even have done a real challenge match. Not brilliant moves.
