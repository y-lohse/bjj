title: Slight redesign
---
After nine month of faithfull service (I started this blog on january 29<sup>th</sup>), the time had come for a slight redesign. [90% of the web is text]() and for sure 90% of this journal as well, so the whole design relies on solid typography. I kept it that way but got rid of [Cousine](), the monospaced font I used. The newcomer is [Merriweather](); I was already using the sans version for the menu but decided to go full Merriweather after seeing [Matthew Palmers blog](http://matthewpalmer.net/blog/) â€” it has the old-school, very scholar style that initally drew me to a monospaced font, but it's more elegant and calls a little less for attention.

Yes, this post is about design and not BJJ.
