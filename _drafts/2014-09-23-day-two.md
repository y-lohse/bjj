# Daniel Bertina: Big Pressure Armbar

## Set-up

From closed guard, the left hand grabs the same side wrist and the right hand cups the cross-triceps. A pull on that arm brings the opponent into an arm drag/arm bar position. Switch to a higher guard, one leg trapping the shoulder and the other one locking the guard above, putting a lot of pressure on the shoulder.

## Option One: Americana

Because the armbar is telegraphe, a possible defense is to pull in the shoulderand hopefully the elbow. The americana is a good pre-emptive counter to that:

- my left knee pushes down towards the ground and the right knee
- my right arm pushes into the opposite direction, my left arm keeps his arm from straightening
- hips rise

## Other Options

Attacking the wrist is very doable from there. Straightening the arm is a defense to both the americana and the wrist lock but leads straight into the arm bar. If he pulls the arm away, the triangle is right there. And of course, the omoplata isn't far away either.

> Whenever there's an arm bar, there's an arm drag

# Christian Graugart: Triangle Defense

Obviously, it's better to not even wind up in a triangle. But when it happensâ€¦

## Early Escape

Keep a good posture and create a frame with my arms on the free-arm side. One hand anchors on the hip bone, the other one grabs the wrist. My knees go under his hips and I look upwards.

## Not So Early Escape

If my posture is broken down, create a *little* space with my arms to buy some time. STand up pressuring with both hands on the chest and pull the opponent below me. Awkwarldy, throw my leg over my inside arm and thentheotherleg above that. Cross the ankles and push to break the lock. Keep my thumb pointed towards his chest to prevent the armbar.

## Late Escape

When everything else failed, grab his leg with both hands and yank it down. Then sprawl hard to the closed side to prevent him from getting the right angle. Then wait for the next shit to happen.


# David George: DLR Attacks Against Combat Base

Attacks start

## Sweep #1

With a left DLR hook, put the hook on his hips and move my right leg out of reach for him. This leg then steps on his DLR-side shoulder and elevate my hips. From there,drop the DLR hook and start turning towards the hook side but *without inverting*. Knees to the ground, toes in attack mode and keep driving to the side.
