# Gunnar

Was sort of uninteresting. From standing with double butterflies in, he stresses the importance of getting his knees together. From there he frees one leg, side steps, and goes into the classic pass with a knee in and a hand  on the far hip, flaring the elbow out.

If only one leg is on the outside, he will sort of sit on the trapped leg, bring is outside knee on the opponents thigh or chest to pin it, wrap the trapped leg with his outside arm, head on the inside, and essentially smash pass from there. He can also end up inverting his opponent and finishing the pass there.

# Art of inversion

How to invert. Ntohing new on that, but a bood way to think about things:

- Inverting in degrees. Sitting is 0, on the first shoulder it's 90, upside down is 180, and the other shoulder is 240
- Depth: am I looling at my opponents eyes, or at his butt ? This defines how deeply inverted I am, and different techniques require different depth
- Height: Where my hips are

Geenrally, I should try to get my hips higher then the opponent.
