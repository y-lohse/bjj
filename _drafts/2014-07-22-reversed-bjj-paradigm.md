title: The Reversed BJJ Paradigm
---
So… yeah. [Paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm). That's a word mostly used in science papers. A paradigm is a way to conceive and area, a thinking model, a framework. BJJ education mostly conforms to a paradigm:

- learn techniques with details at slow speed
- figure out a concept that drives multiple techniques
- try to use them during live sparring
- drill specific technqiues to engrain them in your muscle memory

After finishing my last entry it became clear to me that my issue is with the two first points.

But I believe we could — and should — learn things the other way around: first the concept, then the techniques.

This is simply a more sustainable way to learn. Learning the basics of a technique may be a little shorter than learning a concept but a concept gives you the basic for several techniques at once. A concept can usually be applied to several positions as well.

# A rather obvious example

I'm working on more complex topics but just to demonstrate the point here, I'll give a short example. In the following videos, focus on the following techniques if you're not familair with them:

1. scissor sweep (first video)
2. scissor sweep — knee push variation (first video)
3. spider scissor sweep (second video)
4. DLR knee push (third video)
5. Hip bump (fourth video)

The names give it away, but those 5 techniques are pretty much the same.

First both upper bodies align. #1, #2, #3, and #4 use a sleeve grip to attract the opponent while with #5, you are the one moving.

With #1, #3, and #5 you then post a foot against your opponents leg so that he well trip on it. With the hip bump this is done naturally, but the scissor sweeps have an extra step where you position your free foot. Eventually, you initiate the sweep. #1 and #3 use a scissor motion with the legs and #5 uses the hip (yup, good naming right there).

#2 and #4 combine these last steps into one: instead of blocking and sweeping, you kick out one of the legs, initiating the sweep at the same time.

There are minor variations between those techniques but the concept is pretty much the same: align, remove a base and roll. And those are just five techniques on top of my head that use this concept, but there are more.

# How can a concept be taught without technique?

Honnestly I don't think thats possible, but maybe I'll come up with something. But the key difference is that you should explain the *concept*, not the techniques. They are just there to illustrate the point, don't bother getting into details.

Right now, I'm inclined to think that the following structure would work well:

0. Warm up with exercises that relate to the concept.
1. Explain the concept and illustrate it by roughly showing some techniques using it. Not just one technique, there have to be severall to spur some ideas.
2. Let every student try the concept out. They should be abble to reproduce at least one technique. Incencitize them to find other applications for the concept. This should be R&D between groups of 2 or more students. Higher belts with more mat time can probably come up with more ideas.
3. general debrief. Cover points of failures, other technqiues that you hand't shown before. If some groups came up with new application, let them demonstrate it.
4. Thematic sparring at 50% or lower. Keep practicing the concept but agaisnt a mildly resisting opponent. This is also the time to find counters which shouldn't be too hard because both players understand the concept. No deceptions allowed during the first couple of rolls, then yes. Alternate 5 minutes (or whatever), always the same person attacking and the other defending.
5. Allow time for technique specific questions. This is where you can give some tips & details.
6. Full speed sparring.

Of course that would be one very long lesson and theres probably too much to understand, especially if you're new to the concept. The whole cycle should be spread out over several lessons and each lesson doenst need to include all 7 steps.

Please note that I haven't tested this *paradigm* yet.

# What about drilling

Drilling is boring but muscle memory is very real. I don't think you can make a whole class drill the same move because there are very few techniques that everyone uses. But then micromanaging the students isn't an option either, so I don't really have an answer for this.
