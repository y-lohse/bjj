title: Affiliation. And thoughts.
---
In what has to be one of my most ironic moves so far, I joined [the BJJ Globetrotters](http://www.bjjglobetrotters.com/), a firmly non-political community — for political reasons.

Well, let's correct that before I get kicked out: politics are absolutely not the only reason I joined. I think their values shouldn't be something a community has to state — they are what BJJ is about and should be a minimum.

> - We don’t pay each other any affiliation fees
> - We wear any patches we like on our gis
> - We are free to represent any (or no) team in competition
> - We encourage training with anyone regardless of affiliation
> - We are willing to promote anyone who deserves it—members or not
> - We arrange camps, seminars and visit each other for training and fun
> - We believe everyone is equal both on and off the mats
> - We strive to enjoy life, people and the world through Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

Also, I'm planing to attend their 2014 fall camp and I think you have to be a member to join, but I'm not sure. And on top of that I was jealous of my friends Florian & [Marie-Laure](http://www.art-of-bjj.com/en/)'s patches, so now I'll get to wear them as well.


# Back to politics

The political reason that made me join the BJJ Globetrotters is that the other, default affiliation I'd have is Gracie Barra. But I don't feel we are part of them, at all. The academy owner is a brown belt under under a GB affiliate but I've never met anyone from the headquarter, not even their blackbelt. I don't feel a part of them and I don't want to represent them.

My previous academy was somewhat afiliated to David Pierre-Louis and through him to De La Riva. I never met De la Riva but David had (and still has) a huge influence on my game so representing him would suit me totally well, but that's not an option anymore. I *do* toy with the idea of moving to Paris once I'm a dark purple/brown belt to receive my black belt from him. But that is still very far away and a lot of things might change until then. 

My coach, Salah, does represent Gracie Barra — but I believe he doesn't care who he fights for. As long as someone signs him off to compete he's cool. That's actually a topic on which we kinda disagree.


# Teams & creontes

Salah once told me

> If I had my own academy, the sign on the front would just read "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu"

I can see the value in that, but i have to say I really like the team aspect. I may have written it before, but I see a lot of similarities between games i used to play online and jiu jitsu. Well, in those games, teams were always a great aspect. Sure, I'm part of the BJj community as a whole — but I also enjoy being part of team that is fighting the rest of the world.

This is also why i'm not really against the whole *creonte* thing. It's only natural to feel betrayed when someone leaves your group without notice or good reason. The hatred displayed towards some creontes is probably over the top but I don't mind the concept.


… also, if I could, I'd be a /r/bjj affiliate for sure.
