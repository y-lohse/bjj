title: Should I teach?
---
With Salah being away two days of the week and Christian, our academy owner, too busy to teach, we obviously need more teachers. Christian had privately told me at the end of last year that he'd ask some students to give classes… I just dind't expect he'd ask **me**.

But he did and now I don't really know what to do. There are higher ranked people than me at the academy who destroy me on a regular basis and there are lower ranked people who probably know more techniques than I do. What I have for myself is being on the mats almost every single session and probably spending more time thinking about jiu-jitsu than others. Is that enough to legitimately teach?

I feel confident enough to teach the very few subjets that I really know — fundamentals and closed guard, because I have a lesson all figured out about it. That would definitely interest me. I could also just repeat a lesson Salah gave previously; that's just brute memorization and I can do that alright. But it's probably not the best way to spend my time as it involves checking the other groups instead of practising myself.

I probably woudn't get paid either, but my competition fees might be reimbursed. And well, teaching would force me to really understand what I want to show, so that's always good.
