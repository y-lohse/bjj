title: Self confidence through BJJ

Inspired by http://breakingmuscle.com/martial-arts/the-life-changing-benefits-of-brazilian-jiu-jitsu
BJJ had some profound changes on me too, but the most impressive change I’ve seen happened these last months. At the begiing of the year, a new guy cameinto the gym. He’s about 1m70, around 110 kilos (and not of muscle) and in his late 30s. He has a bit of a shriek voice and was very shy at first. He’d never invite anyone to spare or even drillwith him, he was apologizing every 5 seconds for no particular reason. If all his previous life was like this, I’m pretty sure he was a favorite pick for bully’s.

Only 3 month him, he completely changed. I remember him walking into the dojo one day and jis stance alone felt different, much more confident. He signed up for a tournament after only 4 month of training, he sometimes speaks too loud like every one does, jokes around challenges people. His body hasn’t changed much yet and his technique is still spotty, but mentally he’s on a whole other level. Witnessing changes like that is a huge motivation for me.
