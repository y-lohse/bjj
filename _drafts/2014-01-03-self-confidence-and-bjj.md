title: Self confidence through BJJ
---
Inspired by [The Life Changing Benefits Of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](http://breakingmuscle.com/martial-arts/the-life-changing-benefits-of-brazilian-jiu-jitsu)
BJJ had some profound changes on me too, but the most impressive change I’ve seen happened these last months. At the begiing of the year, a new guy came into the gym. He’s about 1m70, around 110 kilos (and not of muscle) and in his late 30s. He has a bit of a shriek voice and was very shy at first. He’d never invite anyone to spare or even drill with him, he was apologizing every 5 seconds for no particular reason. If all his previous life was like this, I’m pretty sure he was a favorite pick for bullys.

Only three month in, he completely changed. I remember him walking into the dojo one day and his stance alone felt different, much more confident. He signed up for a tournament after only 4 month of training, he sometimes speaks too loud like every one does, jokes around & challenges people. His body hasn’t changed much yet and his technique is still spotty, but mentally he’s on a whole other level. Witnessing changes like that is a huge motivation for me.

**Update 14/04/2014**: I think he went on vacation to Brazil (not especially to train) over a month ago, and we havn't seen him since. I assume he unfortunately ended up quitting jiu-jitsu.
