# Daniel Bertina: One Second Guard Passes

## Pass #1
Enter the butterfly guard and clamp the elbows together right away. Catch the footon one side using the hand, post the headon the opposite side and jump out into side control.

## Pass #2
Same start but clamp the knees together too to prevent foot movement. Post an elbow on the cross side and backstep.

## Pass #3a
Standing passer x laying opponent. Push one knee down to the ground, ideally pinning itand then get an angle. My second hand cups his free knee. In one move, the first hand pushes the knee back / pins it harder while doing a backstep / shoulder of justice drop.

## Pass #3b
After #3a, start pivoting on the right knee (assuming a right hand side pass) and windshieldwiper over the flatenedleg but under the other, still cuped one. Completing the pass from there is pretty straightforward.

## Step Trough: Jedi Mind Trick
Standing, against a sitting opponent. If there is space under one of his armpits, simply step the cross leg in there. Then follow the motion through and drop to knee on belly. Some prior distraction or actual jedi mind control mayhelp.

## Torando Style
STart circling around a sitting opponent. As he follows the motion, let him go ahead a little. When that happens, put one hand on his hip, push his through with theother hand, towards where he was turning. Drop torando style while doing that.
