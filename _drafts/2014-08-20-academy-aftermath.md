title: Academy Openings Aftermath
---
After two month of doubts and uncertainties, the cloud of dust dissipates over The Great Strasbourg BJJ Schism. Whenever there is more than one BJJ club in a city, drama is bound to happen, it's almost a law. This summer, I witnessed the split here in Strasborug and I'm pretty sure we're headed straight into some drama.

Last year, there were 3 clubs around Strasbourg: 

- Gracie Barra 67, the original and still largest one. that's were I'm at.
- Ozaki Boxing Club / Dachstein. As far as I know it used to be boxing only until the owner fell in love with bjj and started offering classes there too.
- Lutte Lipsheim, more focused on no-gi.

Everyone cross-trained everywhere with some agreements between the owners. All love.

# But then…

GB67 added an extra session monday night and suddenly demanded that people from Ozaki pay an extra fee to attend this lesson. Ozaki countered by requesting an extra-fee for the saturday morning lesson. I don't know why GB67 suddenly demanded a fee, but I understand the reaction from Ozaki. Too bad I was training there on Saturday, I had to pay because of some decision from my own academy I did neither understand nor support. The two owners are not-so-friends anymore as far as I can tell, but everything is great between us, the lower people.

A black belt from Brazil, Thiago, came back to Strasbourg. He used to train here before and while he (allegedly) did some weird things, he was cool with everyone until the GB67 (allegedly) fucked him over. I've heard one side of the story but I'd rather not write anything about it until I hear the other side. So now he's back for good and oppened his own academy.

A purple belt who used to pop-in here and there over the last year is about to open his crossfit studio with some mats inside for BJJ lessons.

# Where to go?

There are no contracts in France, you pay for the year up front and that's it. So I'm now free to go wherever I want. So what do I want? A couple of things.

One of the most important things to me is to keep on training under Salah because he's an awesome coach and person. Problem is, Salah will now be dividing his time between GB67 and the crossfit place — and his family, his second son was born just before Metamoris 4. Salah teaches on the nights were cross-training is allowed so the only place were I couldn't go because of this is at Thiago's. i've trained there once, Thiago is a really cool guy, very knowledgable and demanding. But the mood at his academy isn't great and I think I learn better with Salah's teaching style.

Ozaki iss a really great academy but I have a 40 minute drive to get there, so I'd rather avoid that. Lipsheim has two extra classes, none of which are really interesting to me.

The other thing that I want is stay with the closest friends I made, namely Jan, Ahmed, Florian, Marie-Laure & Mathias. But nobody really knew where to go either. Ahmed hinted he'd like to go to the crossfit academy but he's not back from holliday yet so I do'nt know what he's going to do. Jan works with Thiago and they are good friends, but i think he also enjoys rolling with the rest of us. Dunno where he's going. Florian decided to go to Lipsheim, Marie-Laure may do that too. Mathias likes Muay Thai and you can do that at the crossfit place too.

Affter yesterday night, I decided to stay at GB67. I don't see eye to eye with the owned on many things but I can train 4 times a week plus one at Dachstein, with my friends although less often.
