# 12 September
Last months explorations was quite dense because I came of a one month break, but since I'll have less to say this month I'm reverting to the old exploration structure.

I haven't done as well as I would like these past days. I partly blaim the fact that I had no internet to fuel me with ideas of things to try out, a situation that is now thankfully over. We're still working on Collar & Sleeve mechanics but it's starting to be tiresome, I'd like to work on other things. There's now a steady flow of new students, we'll see in a while who ends up staying.

Ten days until Copenhagen! I can't wait, it's going to be awesome.

Next week [Salah will start at his new position]() at FitnessBox 67 and only teach twice a week. the owner of Gracie Barra asked me if I'd be interested in teaching, but my thoughts on this deserve their own post.

A colleague of mine has a blind son. i usually dn't try to sell BJJ to people around me but mentionned we now offer kids class and that it's something he could do, and even do well. His son enjoyed the first session last week so they should be back for more tonight. I'm really glad he liked it and hopes he sticks to it, as it will undoubtly be hard over time.
