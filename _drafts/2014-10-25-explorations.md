Coming back from the camp wasn't easy; I quickly started missing full time training and while I love Salah's lessons, I have to admit the ones at the camp were even better. We're working on a couple of attacks from the lasso but I'm not focusing too much on them — they are techniques I already know and haven't found a way to integrate in my game.

However I have my hands full with implementing everything we sawduring the camp. I actually got a surprising number of them to work — the kimura grip sequence, x-guard, turning the wheel… Everything is still a bit messy in my head but we're getting there. I think my most notable improvement is my defense from shitty positions — the number of times I've been submitted dropped very significantly. Overall it's a relief to not end up in a slump as Florian told me might happen after such intensive training.

Another interesting devlopment has been my improved ability to sense imbalance and "holes" in my opponents structure. It's especially astonishing how against white belts I can create big imbalances with very gentle nudges or simply "flow" around them, driving them into submissions with barely any contact. I can't focus on this against pressure players but I'm starting to sense this kind of things even against higher belts.
