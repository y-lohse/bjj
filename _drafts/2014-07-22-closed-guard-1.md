title: Closed Guard Introduction & First Cycle
---
I'm kicking of a series of posts describing how I'd teach certain aspects of Jiu-Jitsu and the first subject is going to be closed guard — because it's the position I'm the most comfortable in. Yet there are still some aspects of it I ignore; I tried to mark them out.

# Inroduction

The closed guard may very well be the easiest of all guards to learn. In any guard, a number of factors come into play and decide what will happen: pass, sweep or submission. In the closed guard however, some of these factors — passers leg work, distance management, … — are very constrained, leaving us with fewer thing that require our attention.

Most opponents will be wise enough not to throw themselves into your closed guard because in modern jiu-jitsu, it just isnt an even position anymore. I think it was Keenan Cornelius saying that “If you're in someones closed guard, you're loosing” (can't find the source though). Still a lot of fights will include a sequence of closed guard, if only because a lot of escapes bring you back there.

We won't cover th dynamics of getting to the closed guard though — we'll focus, as you may have already seen, on what to do when you have the opponent in your closed guard. If you're the one in the guard… just do the opposite :).

# First Cycle: Posture

## Warp ups

guard jump, crunches from the guard, grip strengthening, technical stand ups, himp bump crunches, push ups.

## The concept

Posture is probably the most important aspect of closed guard as it dictates a lot of the available options to both players. Instead of focusing on pure posture, pay attention to the angle between the 2 upper bodies. The result of each players posture is this angle, it's the consequence to the posture, and it's what actually interests us. The good news is there are really only 3 angles that ever occur in a fight:

	<figcaption>
		At 0°, both upper bodies are stuck together
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
	<figcaption>
		At 70°. usually the guard player is flat on his back, the passer has his back straight and slightly postures forward.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
	<figcaption>
		90°, straight as an arrow.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

We're going to breack down each of those 3 possibilities, but they are all very dense. It's probably better to only cover one angle every class.

## Zero

If your plan is to work from the closed guard the 0° angle is simply the best option. Whatever the opponent wnats to do he'll have to get back t oa better angle first, leaving you with time to prevent this or oppenings for counter attacks. Yet *you* have many available options. Here are just a few:

- flower sweep
- head-over sweep, to some extend
- back-take
- triangles
- armbars
- kimura
- overhook choke
- cross colar choke
- inverted baseball choke?

Here are at least two other notesworthy aspects of this angle: first, it doesn't matter if your back is flat to the mat or not. If you straighten up and hook your opponent, it still is a 00 angle and you could do pretty much the same things. the problem is that when someone is hugging you like that, it's hard to stay upright.

Similarly, a 0° closed guard is pretty much like a full mount. Don't go for sweeps, but most submissions translate very well to the mount.


## Ninety

The 90° angle is a bit of a fallasy, it shouldn't exist — and I rarely see it at higher levels. When posturing up from 0° it's quite tempting to go to 90° because it gets you far away from the guard player. And it's true, submissions will be hard catch… However, 90° is *too* far and if the gaurd players encourages the motion, new opportunities open up.

This encouragemnt is usually done with the hip bump sweep. You can trap the arm and sweep or let it free on purpose to make the passer (who at this point isnt passing anything) base on the hand. This opens up kimuras, triangles... See the 60 techniques from hip bump. I also managed to land some kind of scissor sweep from that position but I've never seen that technique anywhere else.


## Seventy

Sevently degrees is rightfully considered to be a good posture; at that angle, the passer is sufficiently far away to prevent 0° attacks but not leaning back enough to allow the 90° ones. So what is one to do?

Well the best thing to do is of course to change his posture and we'll see a couple of ways to do hat in the next lesson — but it's not always easy. If you can't alter his posture, there's no point in maintaining a closed guard that will be split opened in a few seconds. Thats the point where you'll want to switch to an open guard.

Open guard itself is a very broad topic so we'll just take a glimpse at it here. The basic approach is to start some dead simple attacks like scisor sweeps and variations (spider scissor, spider roll, ...). The passer will *have to* react to the threat and the reaction will open up new opportunities. There's at least one complete system .


70° est considéré comme une bonne posture à raison: a cet angle, votre adversaire est suffisament loin pour que les sousmissions soient difficile mais pas assez ni en avant ni en arriere, bloquant les sweeps dans ces directions (flower et head ovr etant des sweeps vers l'avant). Mais il n'y a pas à déséperer. Le plus effiace est evidement de casser sa posture ou de le forcer à passer en 90°, mais ce n'est pas toujous facile. Si vous ne parvenez pas à influer sur la posture de votre adversaire, le moment est venu d'ouvrir la garde. Vous pouvez éviter que l'adversaire ne se releve avec des bon grips et utiliser des gardes ouvertes simples: les sweeps lateraux sont possibles (scisor, spider scisor, spider roll?) et le réaction adverses à ses menaces vont ouvrir des soumissions (triangles, omoplata -- on est trop loin pour les kimura ou les cléés de bras).

Quelque soit l'angle de la posture adverse, un facteur va beaucoup jour sur vos possibilitées: votre mouvement de hanches. Toutes vos attaques reposent sur un degré variable de liberté de mouvement pour vos hanches (afin de créer un angle, on va y revenir). La bonne nouvelle c'est qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de façons de limiter votre mouvement de hanches. Son tronc ne suffira pas, s'il utilise se jambes il se renverse lui meme. Il lui reste donc les bras, ce qui nous amene a notre second facteur…
