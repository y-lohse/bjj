### Things to do, at some point

- add LSI
- add some form of sharing buttons
- maybe paginating
- maybe search feature
- add titles to category pages
- on mobile the menu takes up too much vertical space
- category icons may be fun
- galeries and links on images
- capitalize all titles
- check drop caps collisions on short paragraphs
