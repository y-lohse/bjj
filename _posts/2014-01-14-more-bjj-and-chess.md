title: More BJJ & Chess
---
I’ve already rambled about [the similarities I see between BJJ and chess]({{ site.baseurl }}2013/12/19/starcraft.html) but there is a core difference that makes BJJ a much harder game. In chess, you only need to master theory — the act of moving a pawn is not a challenge. In bjj, you can have a great understanding of some conceptual theory but if you can’t execute the move properly theory alone will never be enough.

So while I love focusing on broad concepts and theory, I need to start drilling my moves with more intensity. No one is good enough to avoid it, and certainly not me.
