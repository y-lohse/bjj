I’m a bit late to the party, but Luke Thomas recently interviewed Eddie Cummings. You can listen to the audio below or read a partial transcript [here](http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/8/28/9221527/eddie-cummings-on-why-hes-a-scathing-indictment-of-how-jiu-jitsu).

Despite the clickbait-ish title, there’s no drama but *a lot* of fantastic conversation going on — rulesets, crediting invention, educating referees, etc. And I agree with a lot of it but here’s one part where I don’t:

> I don’t believe jiu-jitsu is going to become a spectator sport the way, say, baseball or football or cricket are. I think it’s a very cerebral sport, it’s very intricate.

These things — a cerebral and a spectator sport — are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Eddie later cites the example of chess which is sure as hell not a spectator sport. But consider an esport like League of Legends: it’s cerebral as well and *very* intricate. If you haven’t put serious hours into it, there is no way you can enjoy the action. You’ll get the broad picture of who wins, but that’s about it.

Look at [33:43](https://youtu.be/xOLLJ3RwSGk?t=33m43s).

And yet major League of Legends events have [a *massive* audience](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/19/5123724/league-of-legends-world-championship-32-million-viewers). I’m not saying BJJ will ever reach those numbers — there are far more League of Legends players than BJJ practionners, so many more potential spectators. But with a much improved spectating culture and more general awareness of grappling, who knows?
