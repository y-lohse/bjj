title: Gi Review VHTS G2
---
I’ll by reviewing some gis soon and need a generic disclaimer I can link to, so here it is.

I’m not a huge gi nerd. I kinda know the different brands and types of fabric and stuff, but I don’t own a lot of gis. I do have both a 30€ and a 200€ model so I have experience with high and low end models. Unless stated otherwise, i pay for my gis and no one asks for the review.

I know a couple of things about design. Clothing design certainly isn’t my experise but I’m abble to apply knowledge from other design areas.

I’m 1m96 (6’5") and 87kgs (190 pounds). They call me the Sizing Chart Dead Spot©. I’m A5 in terms of length and A3 in terms of weight. Finding a gi taht suits me well is extremely difficult.
