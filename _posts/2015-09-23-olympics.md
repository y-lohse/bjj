> One overarching federation above them all would be required for BJJ to qualify as an Olympic sport. This is highly unlikely, however, as neither of these groups would want to relinquish either control or profits to another Olympic committee.

It’s a very comprehensive article on the matter and the conclusion, even if not stated, is obvious: BJJ won’t be in the Olympics any time soon, and it’s better this way. Not only are there major issues in the way, but addresisng each one of them requires leaving some part of the BJJ culture behind.

People want Jiu-Jitsu to be an Olympic sport because of the prestige, but lately neither the sports nor their athletes seem to benefit from it.
