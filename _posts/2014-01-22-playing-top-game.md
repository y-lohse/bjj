title: Playing top game
---
I’m not saying I mastered open guard or anything, but it has become pretty decent. I’ve had several people tell mee how hard I was to pass, some top blue belts still smash pass it but overall it’s holding up steady. So I started playing passer against other white belts… and it’s fun!

Our coach Salah makes us drill a lot of sidecontrol transitions and I finally managed to get them going live, and it’s super fun to slide around my opponent while he’s trying to catch me.

I’m also trying to get [the reverse omoplata](http://aesopian.com/2969/12-minutes-reverse-omoplata-goodness/) working, right now I’m still unable to properly isolate an arm from top turtle but chasing the arm alone opens up a lot of opportunities.

In that spirit I also backed [Aesopians & Matt’s indiegogo project](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/aesopian-s-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-instructional), and I'm relly excited about their new approach to teaching.
