title: Props to the IBJJF
---
I’m among the first ones [to complain]({{ site.baseurl }}/explorations/2014/06/30/explorations.html) when there’s something wrong, so let’s give credit where credit is due: IBJJF made the nogi worlds stream available for free, with the again excellent Dan Lukeheart on comments. It’s all on youtube so I can watch it on my TV. Really awesome.

The next great thing would be to index the fights in the one huge video they provided — or even better, chunck that beast. [BJJFights](http://bjjfights.com/) is doing the work anyway, but yeah. Official is better. And while I’m dreaming, a blended-in scoreboard and timer would be perfect. But we’re getting there.
