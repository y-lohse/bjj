title: (Actual) Promotion!
---
I have been promoted to blue belt! Now that it has been a couple of days, I’d like to take some time and reflect on it.

# What it means to me

Getting this blue belt is clearly one of the biggest achievement of my life. Comparable things like graduating or getting my drivers license were relatively easy — but I had to put in a lot of effort to get this belt. Not just sweat mind you, it has been a journey of doubt, discovery, confidence, curiosity and much more.

At the same time I also try not to get too carried away by my promotion, because it’s only a first step. There is far more work ahead than behind and I’m afraid that if I rest on my laurees for even a short time, I might loose the flame.

# What it feels like

My first session as a blue belt went well but in the second, the apparently usual things started: white belts that used to fear me tried to bite my head off. Fresh blue belts wanted to tool me. The switch from *I’m the champion of white belts but blue belts kinda like me too* to *most everyone has a satisfied grin when I get armbared* is kinda funny.

But the truth is, nothing changed over night. I have the same chops than last week, there are things I know and a fucking lot of things I don’t. There’s no way I would give advice to someone without being asked. Even when asked, I would only reluncantly teach something that is not part of my core game. I just don’t know shit yet.
