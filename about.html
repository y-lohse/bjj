            My name is <a href="http://yannick-lohse.fr/">Yannick Lohse</a> and I train in Strasbourg, France. I’m 24 and currently a blue belt. I took up jiu-jitsu in april 2012.

            I started this journal because I figured it would be fun to see in a couple of years what kind of crap I was thinking aa a white belt. I’ve also been using it to formalize thoughts, complain, track my progress and more.

            If I mention your name or include a picture of you and you’re not cool with that, shoot me an email, I’ll take it down.
