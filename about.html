title: About this journal & me
---
<p>
My name is <a href="http://yannick-lohse.fr/">Yannick Lohse]</a> and I train in Strasbourg, France. I’m 24 and currently a blue belt. I started the journey in april 2012.
</p>

<p>
I started this journal because I figured it would be fun to see in a couple of years what kind of crap I was thinking aa a white belt. I’ve also been using it to formalize thoughts, complain, track my progress and more.
</p>

<p>
If I mention your name or include a picture of you and you’re not cool with that, shoot me an email, I’ll take it down. If you’re offended by something I wrote, i’m sorry. If you think something I wrote is stupid, I don’t care.
