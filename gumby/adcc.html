	So let’s go back at ADCC 2005, which was held in the United States for the first time. It was an interesting year historically and in retrospect a big transition not only for ADCC, but for Combat Arts as a whole. Previous to this year I would argue that ADCC was not only the most prestigious grappling event, the prizes earned were larger than most MMA purses as well. You still had a lot of current and future MMA (UFC) athletes that would enter the event. While there was a spectacular final between Roger Gracie and Jacare (Marcelo Garcia and Xande Ribeiro were also on the podium), the event also featured future MMA superstars such as Shinya Aoki and Georges St. Pierre.

	There was an after party of sorts where competitors and staff hung around the hotel restaurant and bar. Mostly people were exhausted and mostly drifted off in short order but there was a dedicated group (a few staff like myself and mostly competitors who had been eliminated in earlier rounds so were less tired). As they say, one beer led to another which led to another and soon enough there was an impromptu ADCC consolation tournament going on in the hotel lobby.

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Sanchez">Diego Sanchez</a>, born 1981, is a mixed martial artist (25 - 7) with a background in Wrestling and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Jackson_(MMA_trainer)">Gaidojutsu</a>.

	About a dozen to twenty of us had gathered around in a makeshift arena and matches occurred one at a time. The king of the mountain of these matches was <a href="#note:1" class="note">Diego Sanchez</a>. Diego was fresh off of his victory at the inaugural Ultimate Fighter which was going to be the turning point of MMA as we know it, but Diego had actually received his ADCC invite prior to filming the show. Although the UFC would have definitely preferred that he sit this one out, he had told them there was no way he was passing up this opportunity. The matches were friendly but there were enough of us gathered around and drunkenly yelling to make a ruckus, enough so that the hotel’s lone security guard came out to investigate, took one look at the crowd and high tailed it out of there.

        I think Diego had a couple of “matches” as it were and no one was getting him out of the circle we had formed, when suddenly the group opened up a bit and there was <a href="#note:2" class="note">Uriah Faber</a> standing there. Uriah was standing there with a stern look on his face like he meant business and a bit of a hush fell over the group. “<i>Ohhh</i>” goes the group as Diego and Uriah just silently nod at each other and then lock up. Neither one of these guys wanted to concede anything much less a takedown and the hush of the group turns into a roar as we are watching what is surely an epic battle.

        Suddenly there was an audible pop. The group goes silent and as Diego and Uriah untangle it become apparent that Uriah rolled over his ankle in a bad way and it starts swelling almost immediately. Suddenly the crowd disperses as quickly as a neighborhood ball game when a window gets broken. Diego is apologizing profusely but really isn’t too capable of doing anything at that point. Scotty (my partner at OTM) and myself wind up carrying Uriah up to his hotel room (Uriah couldn’t remember or tell us what room or even floor he was on at first so we carried him through a bit of the hotel. We fill up a bucket at the ice machine, wrap his ankle the best we could and left him there.

	I didn’t see Uriah the next morning, and not a lot of the participants from the night before could even remember what happened. I did talk to Uriah about the incident sometime later and while he somewhat remembers the match, he had no idea how he made it to his hotel room.
